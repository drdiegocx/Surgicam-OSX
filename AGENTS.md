# Agent Instructions

## Scope
These guidelines apply to the entire repository unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` is created in a subdirectory.

## General conventions
- Prefer semantic HTML elements and descriptive ARIA attributes when editing templates.
- Keep class names in kebab-case.
- Use CSS custom properties for any values that should be themeable.
- When authoring JavaScript, encapsulate logic in small functions and avoid polluting the global scope.
- Preserve existing functionality while modernizing layout or styles.
